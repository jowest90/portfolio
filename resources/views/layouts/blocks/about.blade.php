Growing up, I have always been connected to computers, but it was not until I discovered programming in 2010 that prompted me towards a career in Computer Science.
Having developed the knowledge of not only programming but also problem solving has definitely proved to be something I truly enjoy.
Recently, I've worked with both Acertus and First Hearltand Capital as a PHP Laravel developer.
